    "Maternal health risk can be defined as the health of a mother during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period (World Health Organization, 2019). 287,000 mothers died during and after pregnancy and childbirth in 2020. These deaths can be caused by many different variables so being able to create a predictive model using all these variables will be beneficial in preparing for and preventing these deaths. \n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive question we will try to answer is: Given a patient’s score on 6 different numerical variables (age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, heart rate), can we predict the risk level of a patient as low, medium, or high? Furthermore, we will question which factors are most strongly associated with the likelihood of highest maternal risk in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset has seven variables, one of them being the risk level we are trying to predict. The other 6 variables are age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature and heart race. These variables can be used as predictor variables for our final prediction. \n",

    "As our original dataset contains six numerical variables that may be used as predictors, the first step of our analysis after exploration and wrangling is to perform forward selection to select the most contributive predictor variables to use in our model. This process involves starting with a model with no predictors and building up candidate models by sequentially adding predictors until finally selecting a model that has the best balance between accuracy and simplicity. With m=6 possible predictor variables, we will end up training 1/2 m(m+1) = 21 models. After running forward selection, we will fit a predictive model using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm and visualize the results through a facet grid of scatter plots. The axes will reflect the most contributive predictor variables determined by forward selection. Finally, our method is subject to change as we progress through the course and learn new concepts that may inform the data analysis we aim to conduct.\n"

    "\n",
    "We anticipate finding patterns and relationships between the six numerical variables (age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, heart rate) and the risk levels of maternal health. Specifically, we expect to identify combinations of these variables that are strongly associated with higher maternal health risk levels.\n",

    "#### What impact could such findings have?\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings could have significant implications for maternal healthcare providers. By accurately predicting maternal health risk levels, healthcare providers can identify high-risk patients earlier in their pregnancies and provide appropriate care plans. This could potentially lead to the creation of automated risk assessment, a reduction in maternal mortality rates, and improved maternal health outcomes.\n",
