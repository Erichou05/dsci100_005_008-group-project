    "Maternal health risk can be defined as the health of a mother during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period (World Health Organization, 2019). 287 000 mothers died during and after pregnancy and childbirth in 2020. These deaths can be caused by many different variables so being able to create a predictive model using all these variables will be beneficial in preparing for and preventing these deaths. \n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive question we will try to answer is: Given a patientâ€™s score on 6 different numerical variables (age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, heart rate), can we predict the risk level of a patient as low, medium, or high? Furthermore, we will question which factors are most strongly associated with the likelihood of highest maternal risk in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset has seven variables, one of them being the risk level we are trying to predict. The other 6 variables are age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature and heart race. These variables can be used as predictor variables for our final prediction. \n",
